# Road_Fighter
New version of classical konami game road fighter

#### **first you need to install python3 and pygame to run it on your local machine**
to install pygame, use command:
*sudo apt-get install python3-pygame*

## Introduction
This a game in which you drive a car in a death race between you and a group of mad drivers.
### Your aim?
To compete with your own gaming and reach high scores before you run out of fuel.

**Sounds easy??...** Far from it, there's a lot of obstacles between your car and the fuel checkpoint.

During the game, you should try not to hit the borders of the road neither run yourself into someone else's car.
And the most important part is fuel. You should try to collect all the fuel recharges you come across during the game.

## Gameplay

The game introduction includes a thrilling sound which creates a challenging feel to the user.
It also includes two options: either to **play** or **quit** the game.

Once we click on the "PLAY" button, the timer countdown starts and the user is ready for a thrill.

- After the game starts, the user can use the arrow keys to dive through the road and save himself from the running obstacles.

- Also, the user has to guide the car in such a way that it does not bump into the bushes and also does not crash with the cars.

- To create a high score, the user has to collect the fuel cars that we have set to come on some specific regular intervals.

The random function used for the fuel and the block cars has helped to generate a challenge for the user.

- On the right-hand side of the window, the user can access the current score and the fuel he/she is left with.

- The fuel bar turns red if fuel is low.

- Once the user bumps into the block car or the bushes, a laughing meme is displayed(you thought the game is easy....huh...)

We have **levels** too! As the player scores more, the level changes. Curretly the game has two levels.

### We have also added some basic features like:
- For pausing or unpausing the game: "Space" button can be used.

- For muting or unmuting the sound: "m" button can be used.

### What we did to make the project?
We have made the game using the pygame module in Python.
Pygame is a wonderful module, it helped us a lot to create an exciting game.
That is what motivated us to make a project.
